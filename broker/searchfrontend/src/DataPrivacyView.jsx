    <h4><a name="_Toc343784612" href="/#"  id="_Toc343784612">&nbsp;</a>2. Processing personal data and purposes of processing<br /> &nbsp;</h4>
    <p><b>a) When visiting the website</b></p>
    <p>You may access the website <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"  target="_blank" className=" external">www.fraunhofer.de</a>without having to disclose any details of your identity. What the browser on your terminal device does automatically is only to send information to the server of our website (e.g. browser type and version, date and time of access) so as to allow a connection with the website. This also includes the IP address of your requesting terminal device. It is temporarily stored in a so-called log file and automatically deleted after 4 days:</p>
    <p>The IP address is processed for technical and administrative purposes regarding connection set-up and stability, to guarantee the security and functioning of our website and to be able to track any illegal attacks on the website, if required.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for processing the IP address is the first sentence of point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest ensues from said security interest and the necessity of the unobstructed availability of our website.</p>
    <p>We cannot draw any direct conclusions about your identity from processing the IP address and other information in the log file. Moreover, we use cookies and analytics services when you visit our website. For more information on this, please refer to clauses 4 and 5 of this Data Protection Information.</p>
    <p><b>b) When registering for events</b></p>
    <p>We offer a variety of events through our website on a regular basis, for which you may register online. When registering for an event, you need to enter the following mandatory data. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">First name and surname</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Address </span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Email address</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any other mandatory data are marked as such (e.g. with *). Besides, other data may often be entered voluntarily.</p>
    <p>The mandatory data are processed in order to identify the interested persons as participants of the event, to perform the participation contract, and to provide the participants with information pertaining to the event before, during and after the event. The voluntary data allows us to plan and execute the event based on interest and age criteria.</p>
    <p>Data processing takes place at the request of the interested participants and is necessary pursuant to the first sentence of point (b) of Article 6 (1) GDPR for the purposes mentioned for the performance of the participation contract and in order to take steps prior to entering into it.</p>
    <p>For the registration of our events through our web forms, we work in collaboration with the service provider Mailingwork GmbH, Birkenweg 7, 09569 Oederan (“Mailingwork”). The purpose of the collaboration is to professionally manage online registrations. For this purpose, the entered data is stored on the servers of Mailingwork in Germany.</p>
    <p>We have concluded an order processing agreement with Mailingwork. By this agreement, Mailingwork assures that it will process the data on our account in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and guarantees the protection of rights of the data subjects.</p>
    <p><b>c) When using the ordering service</b></p>
    <p>We offer an ordering service on our website that allows you to order annual reports or the Fraunhofer magazine free of cost as a single copy or as a subscription. To order these, we collect the following mandatory data</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Title</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">First name, surname</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Address</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Country</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may also voluntarily provide additional data (e.g. title, company, department) and provide specifics for your order.</p>
    <p>The collection and further processing of this data takes place in order</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">to be able to identify you as our contractual partner</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">to check the entered data for plausibility</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">to process your order.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Data processing takes place at your request and is necessary pursuant to the first sentence of point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR for the purposes mentioned for the fulfilment of your order and to take steps prior to entering into the contract.</p>
    <p>We work in collaboration with a service provider, lettershop-berlin.de, for processing your order. We manually submit your data to it for your goods to be dispatched. After completion of the order, the service provider will automatically delete the data.</p>
    <p>The personal data we collect for the order is stored with us for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract. If you have ordered a subscription, we will store your data until the termination of the subscription. In case of one-time orders, we will delete your personal data after completion of the delivery.</p>
    <p><b>d) When subscribing to a newsletter</b></p>
    <p>On various occasions, we offer on our website the option to register for a newsletter or press distribution list. If you have expressly given your consent pursuant to the first sentence of point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR, we will use your email address to regularly send you information corresponding to your selection. To receive the information, an email address and the desired language version is sufficient.</p>
    <p>You may provide additional personal data voluntarily (e.g. name, address and telephone number). We use this data to contact you by telephone or post (e.g. for press invitations).</p>
    <p>You will then receive a registration notification by email, which you need to confirm to be able to receive the newsletter (so-called double opt-in). This helps us verify that it is actually you who have initiated the registration.</p>
    <p>Unsubscribing is possible at any time, e.g. via a link at the end of each press newsletter. Alternatively, you may also send your unsubscribing request to <a href="mailto:datenschutz@zv.fraunhofer.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className=" external">datenschutz@zv.fraunhofer.de</a>by email.</p>
    <p>After withdrawing your consent for sending the newsletter, your email address will be deleted immediately.</p>
    <p>We send our newsletter by means of the service provider Mailingwork GmbH, Birkenweg 7, 09569 Oederan (“Mailingwork”). The email addresses and data of our newsletter recipients are stored on our behalf on the servers of Mailingwork in Germany.</p>
    <p>Mailingwork uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletter on our behalf. For this purpose we have concluded an order processing agreement with Mailingwork. By means of this agreement, Mailingwork assures that it processes the data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and guarantees the protection of rights of the data subjects.</p>
    <p>Mailingwork assures that personal data is fully protected against unauthorised access. Mailingwork itself does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them or to transfer the data to third parties. As a reliable email sender, Mailingwork is also certified by the Certified Senders Alliance.</p>
    <p><b>e) When using the contact form for tenders</b></p>
    <p>For queries regarding our tenders, we offer you the option of contacting us directly by means of a contact form provided on the website. The following data are necessary as mandatory data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Title</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">First name and surname</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Company</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Department and function</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Country</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Telephone number</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Email address and</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">Your query</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We require your data to determine that the query has come from a company and to be able to answer and process it. Additionally you may provide your address, fax number and homepage and upload files, if required. The data is processed exclusively for processing your query and is not taken into account for any future award procedure.</p>
    <p>The processing of data takes place upon your request and is within the framework of answering a contact request supported by our legitimate interest pursuant to the first sentence of point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR.</p>
    <p>The personal data collected by us when you use the contact form will be deleted after completion of your query.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc343784613" href="/#" id="_Toc343784613">&nbsp;</a>3. Transfer of personal data to third parties</h4>
    <p>Except for the aforementioned cases (registration for events, using the ordering service, subscription to a newsletter), we forward your personal data to third parties only if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">you have given your express consent pursuant to the first sentence of point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR, </span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you pursuant to the first sentence of point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR,</span></li>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">A statutory obligation exists for transferring pursuant to the first sentence of point (c) of Article 6(1) GDPR.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Especially if you have registered for an event, it may be necessary within the scope of performance of the contract that your personal data needs to be transferred to an external organiser. In connection with an event registration, you will be informed about who the organiser is and whether it is an external organiser. This organiser will process personal data within the scope of the event and especially for the management of participants.</p>
    <p>Sending personal data to a third country (outside the EU) or an international organisation is excluded.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc343784614" href="/#" id="_Toc343784614">&nbsp;</a>4. Cookies</h4>
    <p>We use cookies on our site. Cookies are small files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your terminal device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our site. Cookies do not cause any damage to your terminal device and do not contain any virus, trojan or other malware.</p>
    <p>Cookies contain information resulting from connection with the specific terminal device used. However, this does not mean that we have immediate knowledge of your identity.</p>
    <p>We use cookies to capture statistical data on the use of our website and to evaluate them for optimising our offer for you (cf. clause 5). These cookies enable us to automatically recognize during a new visit to our site that you have visited our site before. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined time.</p>
    <p>The data processed by cookies is necessary for the purposes mentioned with due regard of our legitimate interest pursuant to the first sentence of point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR.</p>
    <p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you may configure your browser so that cookies are not stored on your computer or that you are always notified before a new cookie is created. The complete disabling of cookies, however, may lead to your not being able to use all functions of our website.</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc343784615" href="/#" id="_Toc343784615">&nbsp;</a>5. Web analysis through Leadlab</h4>
    <p>On our website we use the Leadlab service by Wiredminds GmbH and its tracking pixel technology to analyse user behaviour and optimise our site based on it. The service particularly allows us to identify which companies have visited our site. In doing so we do not obtain any information that may identify you directly.</p>
    <p>In connection with the use of Leadlab, cookies and tracking pixels are used which allow statistical analysis of the use of this website through your visits. Information, including personal information about your visiting behaviour, is stored in the cookie and sent to Wiredminds or is directly obtained by Wiredminds. The information is processed by Wiredminds, who use a pseudonym in a usage profile for the purpose of analysis. The data is anonymised to the extent possible.</p>
    <p>The data thus collected is not used to identify you except with your express consent, nor is the data merged with your personal data as a bearer of the pseudonym.</p>
    <p>If IP addresses are collected, they are immediately anonymised after collection by deleting the last number block.</p>
    <p>For more information about data protection at Wiredminds, please visit their <a href="https://www.wiredminds.de/en/data-protection/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className=" external">website.</a>.</p>
    <p>The data is processed based on our legitimate interest, pursuant to point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, to optimise our online offer and our web presence. Wiredminds processes the data on our behalf and we have concluded an order processing agreement with Wiredminds.

    <p>If you do not wish that your usage behaviour is recorded and analysed, you may object by means of opt-out cookies. An opt-out cookie is set which prevents future capturing of your data when visiting this website. The opt-out cookie is only applicable to this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you need to reset the opt-out cookie.</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc343784616" href="/#" id="_Toc343784616">&nbsp;</a>6. Social plug-ins</h4>
    <p>We use so-called social media buttons (also called social media plug-ins) on our website. These are small buttons by means of which you may publish the contents of our website in your profile on social networks.</p>
    <p>If you activate such a button, a connection is established between our website and the social network. In addition to the contents in question, the operator of the social network also obtains additional, partly personal, information. For instance, it includes the fact that you are currently visiting our site.<br /> <br /> The social media buttons are integrated using the so-called Shariff solution. This solution developed by Heise and c’t prevents a connection with a social network from being established just because you access a page with a social media button, without actually activating it. This means that information is sent to the social network only when you press the button.</p>
    <p>We use the following social media plug-ins:</p>
    <p><b>a) Facebook Ireland Limited: share on Facebook</b></p>

    <p>On our website <a href="http://www.maps.fraunhofer.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className=" external"><span className="linklist">www.maps.fraunhofer.de</span></a> we embed the maps from OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a project of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, 132 Maney Hill Road, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands B72 1JU, Great Britain, which collects public domain geodata and provides them in a database for free use.</p>
    <p>When you visit the website, initially no connection to OpenStreetMap’s servers is made. Instead of the embedded maps, you are initially shown only a preview image that we retrieve from our web server.</p>
    <p>For any subsequent interaction on this website (such as a search by institute, region, continent, organizational unit) you are connected to the OpenStreetMap Foundation’s servers and data on the OpenStreetMap Foundation are transmitted in order to display embedded maps. Additional information concerning data protection in connection with OpenStreet Map can be found in the Privacy Policy of <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className=" external"><span className="linklist">OpenStreetMap Foundation.</span></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;When connection is established to display the maps, the following data are transmitted to OpenStreetMap’s servers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span className="bulletpointlist">IP address,</span></li>
